The folders contain the 4-layer reliable and self-adaptive protocol for wireless multimedia sensor network.
- test_heta_rx: the protocol in configured in always-receive mode
- test_heta_tx: the protocol in configured in always-send mode

Each multimedia wireless sensor node is composed of a Raspberry Pi Zero used to process video in real-time and a with Atmel RF used to transmit and receive data.
